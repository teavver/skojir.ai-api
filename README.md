    }
```

Response for User with active (or expired) membership:

```

## Auth endpoints

### ðŸ”’ (POST) `api/auth/refresh` - Refresh auth JWTs using `refreshToken`

```json
{
    "email": "userEmail",
    "otp": "w/e",
    "resend": true
}
```

### ðŸ”‘ (POST) `api/auth/login` - Login to verfied account

Grants `refreshToken`, `accessToken` and `membershipToken` (if the user has an active membership) JWTs on success.\
The `refreshToken` is always returned as httpOnly cookie.\
User sessions are stored per device. The user is allowed to sign out of all devices at any time.

Token type and expiration time:
- `refreshToken` = **14 days**
- `accessToken` = **12 hours**
- `membershipToken` = **12 hours**

```json
